## icCube Dashboards API

The icCube Dashboards API allows for developing new themes, widgets (charts, maps, etc...), data transformations, etc...

### Getting Started

The API is written in Javascript/Typescript and is available as an `npm` package:

     npm install @ic3/reporting-api@latest

See this [page](./doc/Overview.md) for a detailed documentation of the API.

### Embedding icCube Dashboards

Since `8.4.0`, this API does not contain anymore the code for embedding icCube into an existing Web application.
Instead, please refer to the following GitHub [project](https://github.com/ic3-software/ic3-reporting-api-embedded).
