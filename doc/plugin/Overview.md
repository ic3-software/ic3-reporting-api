## icCube Dashboards Plugin Dev. Kit

The icCube Dashboards application depends on plugins to add custom theme, widgets, data transformations, etc... A plugin
is a Webpack module that is loaded at runtime using the **Webpack Module Federation** mechanism.

The plugin dev. kit is available in Typescript.

Even if the icCube Dashboards is written in React, you can write your plugin in plain Javascript/Typescript and use your
favourite libraries. See the working example section below.

Note that Material-UI 5.x is required for accessing and developing a new theme.

### Github Project
