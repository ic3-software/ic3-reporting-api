## Widget Template

A new widget is defined and added to a plugin using a widget template definition that is basically describing the widget
using some sort of meta information and implementing the actual rendering and behavior logic in Javascript/Typescript.

Two kind of widget templates are available:

- [Javascript](./JavascriptTemplate.md) template: implementing a new widget using plain Javascript/Typescript.
- [React](./ReactTemplate.md) template: implementing a new widget using React.
